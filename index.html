            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Carter, a student at the University of Michigan School of Information. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in UX Research and Design, and I have a Bachelor's in Cognitive Science from the University of Michigan as well. <br/> <br/> While my current focus is on UX and front-end development, a majority of my prior knowledge and experience is in working with programming languages such as Python and C++. I feel the interdisciplinary nature of my studies combined with my technical background gives me a unique perspective on design and problem solving.</p>

            <h2>A Coffee Tutorial</h2>
            <p>One of my main passions in life is coffee-making. As a fun little addition to my portfolio, I figured I would share this passion with you via <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oB1oDrDkHM&t=106s" id = "thisoneunder">a video from one of my favorite online content creators!</a> Don't worry about writing anything down; I've got you covered. <br/> Note that this technique is for a v60 brewer with a ratio of 3 grams of coffee to 50 grams of water.</p>
